# CS 260 Notes

## First Notes

I learned a lot about how to commit, push, and pull. I also learned how to clone a repository. I also learned how to make changes using VS Code and GitHub web console.

## AWS

My IP address is: 54.84.21.223
I followed all the instructions and it made sense! At first to see if it was working I put in https://54.84.21.223 and that did not work. But I saw the common problems and the bottom and I realized that I needed to put http not https. Now everything is working.

## Caddy

Got a domain name: groupgoal.click
I followed all the instructions and it made sense. I can now open the link and it is secure! I can open it using https://groupgoal.click.

## HTML

I learned a lot on how to actually use HTML. I know how to add images, links, and making headers/footers. 

Link to my startup HTML: https://startup.groupgoal.click.

Going through the Simon code, really helped me get a feel as to how to actually implement an application.

## CSS

One thing that I found very interesting from going through these modules is how websites can be formatted differently for different screen sizes. I've always wondered how an application can do that, and now I know. I also liked learning about Bootstrap, and I agree that the Bootstrap button compared to the plain button is much better. It creates a better aesthetic to the page.

# Group Goal

[My Notes](notes.md)

> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - Took some going back and editing, but I think I got it!

### Elevator pitch

Have you found yourself exhausted trying to motivate friends, classmates, or coworkers to work on a goal together? Maybe you and your friends want to start saving for that dream trip, or you and your classmates need to get started on that project. The Group Goal application is for users to stay consistent and motivated towards achieving their goals as a team. Users can set personalized goals for their group and keep each other accountable. As users check off tasks, progress is shared live with the group. With everyone working together, goals can finally become reality.

### Design

![Design Image](design_image.PNG)

Here's a sequence diagram that shows how a group of two would interact with the backend to update progress of their goal.

```mermaid

    actor You
    actor Classmate
    participant Server
    You->>Server: Completed Task 1
    Server-->>Classmate: Completed Task 1
    Classmate->>Server: Completed Task 2
    Server-->>You: Completed Task 2 
```

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to create group goals
- Check off tasks
- Live group progress
- Ability for admin to create and delete group goals

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for the application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for habit dashboard. Includes hyperlinks to group progress and habit setup.
- **CSS** - Responsive styling for mobile and desktop. Clean layout with readable fonts, whitespace, and color-coded status. Visual feedback for completed tasks and group activity
- **React** - React components for login, goal list, task check-off, group feed, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieve group goals
  - create a new group goal
  - mark a task as complete
  - get group progress and contributions

- **DB/Login** - Stores users, group goals, and task completion status in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Users must be authenticated to view or update goals.
- **WebSocket** - As users mark tasks complete, the update is broadcast to all group members in real time.
